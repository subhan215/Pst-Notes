When all of Mountbattenâ€™s efforts to keep India united failed, 
he asked Ismay to chalk out a plan for the transfer of power and the division of the country. 
It was decided that none of the Indian parties would view it before the plan was finalized.
The First Plan that was approved by the british government was not made public because Nehru was not happy
 with it.He made some amendments in it and then Mountbatten himself went to london and approved it from 
the british government.In this way, the future of indo-pak sub-continent was decided by a hindu-minded 
congress.
On his return he met some 7 indian leaders including Jinnah and all approved it.The 
plan was made public on 3rd june
The main clauses of the plan were: 
1) The Provincial Legislative Assemblies of Punjab and Bengal were to meet in two groups, i.e., 
Muslim majority districts and non-Muslim majority districts. If any of the two decided in 
favor of the division of the province, then the Governor General would appoint a boundary 
commission to demarcate the boundaries of the province on the basis of ascertaining the 
contiguous majority areas of Muslims and non-Muslims.
2) The Legislative Assembly of Sindh (excluding its European Members) was to decide 
either to join the existing Constituent Assembly or the New Constituent Assembly.
3) In order to decide the future of the North West Frontier Province, a referendum was proposed. 
The Electoral College for the referendum was to be the same as the Electoral College for the 
provincial legislative assembly in 1946.
4)Baluchistan was also to be given the option to express its opinion on the issue.
5)If Bengal decided in favor of partition, a referendum was to be held in the Sylhet 
District of Assam to decide whether it would continue as a part of Assam, or be merged 
with the new province of East Bengal.
